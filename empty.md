<h1>Is it empty?</h1>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another day spent down in Noxipolis, still trying to find any way to help the apocalyptic situation. For Avnlyla, there are also friends here. Beyond the architecture and the sprawling voids it rests on or the natural grounds it suffocates, beyond the mystery or the monsters. Familiar life. Living here as she would live in more familiar places, except in more variations of liminal. Are they living a dream, existing almost the same day to day, like something meant to be? Living a fantasy, being like animate statues or decoration, like sapient wildlife, like background characters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet these ones show or believe themselves to have an entire history and life of adventure, or whatever strange fascination or purpose they feel. It reminds her of when she had a clear purpose, and spent any other time talking with few friends. Maybe here she is a friend to them, even the ones that seem to exist isolated, she likes to think. They are usually pleasant beings, despite everything.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes it for this reason; Caroline and her always loved art and creation, Avnlyla herself never losing the admiration for architecture... Heavens, she wants to be lost here, a place her friend made, a desire to be lost here is something far removed from helping others, a self-indulgent and self-created purpose of exploration and curiosity. Of course, she is here for a reason she is still passionate about, she wants to help everyone, her allies ne-

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ava? Your mind is racing, I promise you this place won't disappear when this is all over," Mare had stopped Avnlyla's runaway thoughts, with that usual soft androgynous voice that seems to appear from both inside and outside her head. Not loud, but omnipresent. Directionless. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are daydreaming. Not to mean any disrespect."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avnlyla could feel Mare's sincerity, and even catch the fleeting glimpses of his own emotions in his communication. She knows Mare values similar things here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Could you not do that? I was..." Avnlyla is unsure how to really speak here, the problem is over already.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just, these are my thoughts- I wasn't trying to speak."

"I was just worried."

"...I would have kept spiraling, to be honest... Thank you."

"Yeah, and you _finally_ made it out of Ataxia." Mare states the obvious, with some genuine excitement behind it.

Her automatic walking finally stops as she realizes she _has_ finally made it. The goal was to newly explore this facet of Noxipolis, further east from the original dimensional gate. It is far less vertical, and far less starry void than what's below the sprawling bridges and whimsical structures that extend northbound, the "Oneiria" facet; There, it seems to have more and more sparse structures as it goes further, with white dots that are the increasingly disconnected structures littering the distant horizon, inaccessible to anything that can't fly or teleport. One could also see this eastern land from a distance, the issue was getting past the off-putting structureless infrastructure of the "Ataxia" facet that bridge the north and central areas to this new land.

She looks up at the decorated sky to breathe in the air, grounding herself with the scent and temperature of a new land. Crisp, autumnal, but with a hint of an indescribable chemical something. Before her, the roads of Ataxia end, and as far as the eye can see begins softly rolling hills and foliage. Solid, natural ground, and sparse trees. Not enough to call it a forest but enough to pleasantly impose themselves wherever one looks with their old growth, as incongruent as that statement is.

"Mare! You're looking too right? It is actual nature, not potted or kept or..."

"Certainly I am, it is beautifully eerie! Do you want to rest for a bit now?"

"I'm fine, walking here has been the easy part. The chaos was yesterday's issue!" Avnlyla lightly replies, she knew Mare knew she was tired, but it wasn't a big deal to them.

Walking through here is seemingly going to be relaxing anyways, and just a minute of such roaming leads her far away from Ataxia, up a hill where she can better see the land. There are indeed still inorganic structures here, mostly paths and some rings that extend above the ground, lifting up their own foliage. The material is of large mortared stone, a very natural and textured gray that contrasts the light and dark concretes of the other facets' materials. Although even more than Oneiria, these structures don't seem to have any purpose, being no more than another part of the environment.

"I guess some of the nature _is_ kept? Just bolstered up by the stone, fascinating..." Mare was looking out as well, trying to observe more specifically.
"Say, you see those shimmering areas, right?"

"I think I do!" It is a somewhat silly statement, considering Mare is seeing from Avnlyla's eyes, but attitude makes a big difference.

She slides down the hill and runs forth to one of the paths, the metal of her soles click against the stone path with every step. Walking, and walking, it is more relaxing now, with the new environment and all its details. She begins to notice the gradient of the grass that continues forward, it slowly has gone from gray to orange, with red approaching in the distance. She sees very distant animals, they have odd colors and shapes, and are seemingly few in numbers. She feels breezes pass her, her mind able to simply linger on the mundanity of it being interesting that there is natural wind here but little wind elsewhere in Noxipolis, rather than anything deep. Walking, walking, until she finds something interesting.

"Soo... Do you think Caroline has named this area already, or do I get to name it?" eagerly remarked Mare.
"I mean, took a lot of effort to even reach this facet!"

"Yeah and _I_ did most of the physical effort! And yeah, Caroline probably has a name for this too, silly."

"Well one day I'll get to make another name for something." Mare speaks with usual enthusiasm. He goes silent for a bit before speaking again, a silence Avnlyla could feel.
"Hey, do you think the effort it took to get here was coincidence? If it was meant to be difficult to reach? Do you know if this means anything? As in, is this dangerous?"

Mare struggled here, confronting the complications of asking such a question. He always tries to keep down the ability to read minds for friends; It leads to better outcomes... However, here was a mystery not even Avnlyla knows. Just how much does Avnlyla actually knows about Caroline? What is there in their images? What is in that space of erased memories, that Mare still can't access?

"I... I don't know. You know I don't know. There doesn't really seem to be anything here. It is... Empty, we haven't seen any hostile creatures, or obstacles, or any people or whatever things could potentially communicate or be anything. I can count the number of creatures I have seen on my hands. Caroline could have probably just wanted to experiment with making natural landscapes or whatever. Sorry..."

"I didn't know. I wasn't trying to know. Just, do you have any ideas? A feeling for if this place has a purpose?"

"..."

Avnlyla slowly spins around, to observe the environment. It isn't calming this time, there is no sign of Ataxia or any familiarity anymore, just endless gradient grass and some trees. The sky has even less symbols than before. It feels colder than before. The air feels drier.

Quieter. Stiller. Emptier. The most exciting thing is the natural wind, and the few creatures in the far far background. The others had animate skies and cluttered locations, simple animals, hostile monsters, beings and structures with functions and goals. Those were harsh in their activity. This feels harsher with nothing.

"I am not sure... It feels, empty on purpose? All the trees are the same, the foliage is more limited than I thought... I... Not just... Not what I said about just, making a natural landscape for fun... It is probably more deliberate. It, really, really isn't anything like the the Caroline I know. Fuck..."

She could only continue to wander in her mind, walking while she feels the calmness of exploration fade with the realization of how dull this place is. Why isn't anything here? Why would Caroline make this?

"Well let's not be too scared then, if it is empty, okay? I... uhm." Mare replies in a rare display of being lost, exposed to Ava's feelings of unease just as much.

\--

"It's just a lake- There are just more lakes over here. How is there _nothing_ here?!" She rants as she eventually leaves the path, which still seems to go on forever. Finally reaching the lake, she crouches at the edge as she reaches her gloved hand into the water.
"The water feels... soft? I don't know. It could just be water."

"Fluffy? I _really_ thought there would be more here. Maybe we try and reach one of those creatures in the distance instead of this? That would probably be something interesting!"

Not responding to Mare, Avnlyla picks up a rock and throws it unenthusiastically into the lake. It hits the liquid with a quick metallic sound, slowly sinking, until it suddenly falls and vanishes.

"Ava...?"

"There isn't anything under the lake! There's just void, the liquid is just floating there. And..." She stands up and looks around a bit more.
"..." But that is all there is to say.

"Well, I am just as much in disbelief that the most exciting thing _in a facet of Noxipolis_ is floating water." She can feel Mare's own disappointment in his snark, and both their silence extends for seconds.
"...I guess we should stop wasting our time."

\--

"Ava! look to the left again!" Mare lights up in a tone familiar to Avnlyla; He's like a compass that jumps to the nearest interesting magical phenomenon.

"You- You have something? Just suddenly now?" Avnlyla asks, but is already moving in that direction herself. Mare had found something.

"Yes! I can feel sapience, vivid sapience!"

Avnlyla approaches the source, feeling Mare's compass. In short distance is another lake, with one of the many sparse circular structures extending from the side over the water. The sky is suddenly more decorated and colorful as they approach it. Atop the circular platform is deep orange, almost iridescent grass, and a unique tree like none other here, with pinkish-red leaves in a wide canopy and a twisting bark. Resting around this tree are ruins of structures, two towards the farther end of the circle remain sound; Large arches of marble clay. A third seems to have broken, split in half near the tree, standing up next to it while its other half has fallen to the ground, laying on its side.

"Hmm... I am not seeing anything. Or, anyone." Avnlyla says softly, while she makes her way to the platform.
"Though this is interesting! It is like a dock over the water, and there is a pretty tree... And... arches?"

\-

"These structures look _exactly_ like they came from Oneiria, which is bizarre. Anyways, Ava, I swear I felt sapience here. Maybe it's buried."

Avnlyla paces around the circle, and eventually stops to observe more carefully. There... As if a moment less of effort would make it lost forever, was a somehow missed humanoid resting against the fallen rubble.

"Mare? Why didn't you tell me about the... thing?" Avnlyla is confused as to how she could miss this, but the more she look at it, the more it feels... Forgettable? Unimportant? Feelings you don't usually get by looking at something, but she assumes Mare of all things would see this.

"What?" Mare says, shocking Avnlyla with his cluelessness, before he catches himself.
"Oh... How _did_ we not see this? I was just doing something else for a second, I swear I had looked enough."

Avnlyla shifts carefully over the curling roots, and kneels to the entity, sitting on her legs. The area is covered in petals and leaves from the tree, the grass is softer than she is used to.
"It's like a mannequin? Like, a glass doll?"

It... is a somewhat short figure, some thing like a mannequin, and like one it is averagely shaped in every way a humanoid could be, although with double ball jointed knees and similar construction elsewhere. The legs end in round points, but the arms possess hands. It has not a face, but a depression, an ovular outline where a face should be, as if one could be clicked into place. The body, translucent, composed somewhere between sea glass, air, and aerogel, shimmering and reflecting the reds and purples and whites of the black sky.

It rests limp, head tilted, sitting against the marble clay pillar, and well supported upon the grass overgrowing around it. The roots intermingle with the ground around it, and seemingly soon the thing's legs. It all seems picture-esque, how the doll is at the center of this structure under the tree.

"This... This is definitely the thing giving off all that energy." Mare thinks on it for awhile, wondering if the being rings any bells.
"Do you think anything of it?"

"I mean, we found something interesting, but otherwise no..." Avnlyla looks at it a bit more from different angles. It is fascinating, but there isn't anything new gained by looking at it, and she is already forgetting any details.

She gently holds its right hand, pushing grass and dust off it. It is frigid, and feels a bit like touching a CRT. She can easily move every finger individually, and they remain as last touched. Eventually, she lifts the hand, lifting the arm and seeing its ball-socket shoulder rotate to move upwards, before letting go. It falls quickly, landing on its thigh with the clink you'd expect of glass. its weightless

"Ava, it could be fragile! And are you seriously gonna play with its arm before trying to wake it up?"

"...Like, say hello?"

"Obviously?"

"Uh." Avnlyla adjusts herself, using her physical voice. "Hi! Hello! Can you hear me? Hey!"

Avnlyla can't see it, but she can feel Mare face-palming. "You aren't taking this seriously, are you?"

"Are you really sure this thing is sapient?" She remarks, still with physical voice, moving her hand to its head and lifting its chin, tilting it to the side, looking at its sides and shapes. It remains completely inanimate.

"Yes, I am beyond positive. Hmmm... Put your hand over its face, and keep it there."

"Alright..." Resting her hand on the indented head, feeling the electrostatic blurriness of the chilled surface, keeping her hand steady but relaxed until told to stop. She knows Mare is probably trying to feel something she can't... Until Avnlyla moves her fingers. Tap, with one, then the other, then the other. Tapping, tapping. The metal of her glove taps, taps, against the glass, letting out a chime. She can see and feel her fingers tapping in sequence, oscillating and moving slowly, subconsciously counting each till five, resetting to zero. She can't feel the air or grass, or see the sky above her. She feels soft.

A pulsing awareness grows, of every thought or feeling's development. Like a new sense was developed, not seeing the growing network of recursion, but knowing it. Tap, tap, with every tap a pulse, a ping, revealing the next step of having a thought, seeing it develop in slowed time. Like if one could see the code that will be ran before it can even process. Except these thoughts are not hers.

She snaps back into awareness, hearing Mare speak with the feeling of shaking her awake. She can't understand him yet. The senses are gone. They made no sense, complete randomness.
