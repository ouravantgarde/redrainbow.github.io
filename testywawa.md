i have no idea what is going on


This is an <abbr title="A juicy fruity!!!!!!">orange</abbr>! But this is an orange too. Unfortunately, this orange does not have an abbreviation tag for it! And none of this works on github itself!

<abbr title="What the buzzy?">**testing buzz**</abbr>

*[apple]: Wow! Every time apple it mentioned, it will give it a tooltip instead of having to set up an html tag for every single instance!

apple and apple two, these use awesome automatic tooltip markdown that works on jekyll sites but not github flavored markdown! apple apple Apple apple

Unforunately Capital Apple is a different word, I would have to set it up again...

How does one create indents? Does a tab or two work?

No it doesn't work, instead you have to make a darn `&nbsp;` for every empty space you need!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, now THIS is indented! This is going to be annoying to do the hundreds of times I must...

Adding this line to update the repo to get it to rebuild since it like, broke? Uping the number here every time I do this: 3
