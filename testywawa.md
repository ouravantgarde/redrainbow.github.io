i have no idea what is going on


This is an <abbr title="A juicy fruity!!!!!!">orange</abbr>! But this is an orange too. Unfortunately, this orange does not have an abbreviation tag for it! And none of this works on github itself!

<abbr title="What the buzzy?">**testing buzz**</abbr>

*[apple]: Wow! Every time apple it mentioned, it will give it a tooltip instead of having to set up an html tag for every single instance!

apple and apple two, these use awesome automatic tooltip markdown that works on jekyll sites but not github flavored markdown! apple apple Apple apple

Unforunately Capital Apple is a different word, I would have to set it up again...

How does one create indents? Does a tab or two work?

No it doesn't work, instead you have to make a darn `&nbsp;` for every empty space you need!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, now THIS is indented! This is going to be annoying to do the hundreds of times I must...

Adding this line to update the repo to get it to rebuild since it like, broke? Uping the number here every time I do this: 5

Dolls, Dogs, and Wawas, prepare thyself... FOR ALL MARKUP EVER!!!! That's right, In order to make sure I can always see the effects of if I mess with the style of any given format done in the md files I am using...

I am going to shrimply type out All Markdown, and then All HTML that isn't already covered by Markdown (ignoring the tooltips above that is cool :>... And ones I don't see myself using ever...)

# Heady Wawa 1

## Heady Wawa 2

### Heady Wawa 3

###### Heady Wawa 6, which I am NO LONGER using as the subtitly wawa, as that would conflict with the autotoc. I will make a custom id for the subtitle style in the future

**Boldy Wawa**

*Slanty Wawa*

~~Crossy Wawa~~

H~wawa~O

wawa^wawa^

WHAT! The wawas above have FAILED their markdown! HTML it is...

And here the Downy Wawas end... With a divider, in markdown

<hr>

And forth come the HTML Wawas!! Who are actually bringing their divider line because markdown didn't work!

Nevermind! Neither wawa is capable of making a line! I will have to look into this...

It has been resolved I think both wawas were capable it just didn't render correctly

wawa<sup>wawa</sup>

<p style="text-align:center">This wawa wants to be in the center</p>

<p style="color:rosybrown">And this wawa wants to be puce.</p>

Who let this wawa be so scrumptious?

{{ -9 | abs }}
